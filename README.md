## Mock-up Screenshots

Below are two mock-up images of the QuizAR website created using the  `<a href="https://ui.dev/">`"Am I Responsive" website `</a>`.

|                         Screenshot 1                         |                         Screenshot 2                         |

## UX

- The design for QuizAR was created as a series of wireframes covering mobile, tablet and desktop to determine the initial design and layout of the site.
- QuizAR site was designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind.
- A simple clean look was built so that all a user feels comfortable and neutral when using QuizAR to study.
- QuizAR is meant for people who need to refresh upon their gained knowledge of AI and it's state of the arts.

### Colour Scheme

- The chosen colour scheme for QuizAR is designed to be inviting and have a neutral aesthetic while giving a nice splash of colour aesthetic for color-blinded people.
- The colours used are as follows:-
- #004D00 (Pakistan green)
- #80a175 (Asparagus)
- #eaead9 (Eggshell)
- #ffffff (White)
- I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/user/palettes/67013760ef070c000ca35293) to generate my colour palette initially.
- I used [coloors.contrastchecker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker) to check the contrast between text and background colors used, ensuring readability.
- I used [colorblindor](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) to ensure my chosen color palette is fit for color-blinded people. This feature was available in Firefox's Developer tools.

### Typography

- I used the Google Font called 'Montserrat' for the QuizAR site.
- I felt that this font had a cool style that is easy to read and that it fitted well with the QuizAR site.

## Icons

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used in the QuizAR site, for GitHub links in the footer and modal and for the search icon in the main weather card.

## [Testing](TESTING.md)

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub Pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Uche05/ci-p2-quizar), navigate to the Settings tab.
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the **Main** Branch, then click "Save".
- The page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

The live link can be found [here](https://uche05.github.io/ci-p2-quizar/).

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Uche05/ci-p2-quizar).
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it.
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard.
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal.
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory.
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
   - `git clone https://github.com/Uche05/ci-p2-quizar.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

For Gitpod users, this was not implemented on gitpod, it was from my local PC directly to Github via git and some useful VSCode extensions.

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Uche05/ci-p2-quizar).
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.

### Local vs Deployment

There are no notable differences between my local developed site and the GitHub pages deployed site.

### Content and Code

| Source | Location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
|[Javascript Code-Check Aid- ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)| Tool to check javascript code as i wrote it | The JavaScript code I wrote was often quite messy, so I used ChatGPT to help correct and update it. Through this process, I learned how to use arrow functions (=>), the forEach function, and discovered the flexibility JavaScript offers, such as storing objects in arrays— something Python doesn’t do as easily. Thanks to ChatGPT’s guidance, my final JavaScript code was error-free. |
